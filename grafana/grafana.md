## Grafana Introduction

### Why we need Grafana?

We all know that Prometheus is a monitoring tool that can be used to collect metrics from various systems. Also it comes with some basic visualization capabilities. **But the visualization capabilities of Prometheus are not so good. If we need to visualize our metrics in a more shopisticated way, prometheus is not a good option. In this case we can use Grafana to visualize our metrics in a more sophisticated way.**

### What is Grafana?

Grafana is an open-source platform for visualizing time series data. In `Grafana` we can connect to many time series data sources like `Prometheus`, `InfluxDB`, `Graphite`, etc. and visualize our data in a more sophisticated way. We can also create alerts in Grafana sometimes we need to create alerts in Grafana instead of Prometheus for some specific use cases like if we want to create alerts based on multiple data sources metrics. Grafana is also suitable for Large Organizations where we have multiple teams and also we have some good access control features in Grafana for different teams.
